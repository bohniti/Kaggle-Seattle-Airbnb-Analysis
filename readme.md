# Kaggle Seattle Airbnb-Analysis

## Abstract

Our work should present, how the marketing effectiveness of Airbnb can be enhanced by the analysis of a dataset of 2016. In order to improve the marketing, the four Ps of the marketing-mix should be addressed. The dataset contains listings of rented apartments and their attributes. The data for the first P, Product, is analyzed by using a WordCloud (obtained by using a Natural Language Processing) the 50 most mentioned words of all reviews on the apartments are displayed according to their neighborhood. Findings for the Price Policy are obtained by using Linear Regression a Neural Network and an Extra Tree classifier, which extracts the features that influence the price have been used. In order to find out when a marketing campaign should be started, the number of visitors over the year is analyzed and a prediction for 2017 is made by Linear Regression. Our findings show, that lessors should put words like “park”, “walk”, “lake” or “downtown” into their description to successfully address their target group. The price for an apartment is dependent of the attributes listed in the dataset, with number as review as attribute with the highest correlation. A good point in time to start a campaign would be February, as the number of visitors starts to decrease in March.
